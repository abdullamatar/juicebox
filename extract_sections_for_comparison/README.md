## still not documented well yet :)
  
`A067` `A072` `A073` are the three folders.
Inside each of them are the two generated/cropped sections (horizontal) and the orignial image (reference image converted to img from pdf).

Note the following:
- multi_up.bmp is the Job1.bmp but manually removed the top and bottom black areas.
- find_images.ipynb is the main notebook.
- Reference Samples and W55* are the original folders as-is
